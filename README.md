# PDFmon
A small and simple PDF pages editor.
So far you can delete pages from a PDF file or merge an arbitrary number of .pdf files.
Maybe other features will come eventually.

You can clone the project, or get the .exe [here](https://github.com/SimonSeibert/PDFmon/releases/tag/1.1)

I developed it as most PDF editors on Windows are overpriced and/or bloated. In most cases, I only need to remove or merge several pages.

Furthermore, I created the application with the goal of gathering more experience using Python, as I have not used it extensively before.
