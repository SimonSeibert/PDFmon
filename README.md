# PDFmon
A small and simple PDF pages editor.
So far you can only delete pages from a PDF file or merge 2 pdf files
Maybe other features will come eventually.

I did this because most PDF editors on Windows are too expensive and/or bloated. 90% of the time I just need to remove some pages.
And it was my first time using Python, so please don't judge my horrible code :)
